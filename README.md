# team17_swd
This was a hackathon competitive project I did my Junior year. We were awarded 1st place out of 63 teams, the catch is that all the other teams were groups of 3 and we were a group of two.

Im pretty sure to run this on your own PC you need Javafx installed and SQL installed for the modules. Also I dont know how long out databse will be up so it most likeley will have errors if you ever pull it and run it.
